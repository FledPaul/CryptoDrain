<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

CryptoDrain is a Python program developed to streamline the process of sweeping crypto wallets using just the seed phrase, without the need for a derivation path. With CryptoDrain, you can securely and quickly withdraw crypto wallets in a matter of seconds, saving you time and effort.


### Built With

SeedSweeper is built using Python 3.11, a powerful and versatile programming language, along with the python-bitcoinlib library, which provides extensive support for working with Bitcoin-related cryptographic functions. Python 3.11 provides a wide range of features and libraries that make it an ideal choice for developing SeedSweeper, while python-bitcoinlib enhances the program's capabilities by providing robust support for Bitcoin-specific operations.
