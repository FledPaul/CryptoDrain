## About The Project
CryptoDrain is a Python program developed to streamline the process of sweeping crypto wallets using just the seed phrase, without the need for a derivation path. With CryptoDrain, you can securely and quickly withdraw crypto wallets in a matter of seconds, saving you time and effort.


### Built With
CryptoDrain is built using Python 3.11, a powerful and versatile programming language, along with the python-bitcoinlib library, which provides extensive support for working with Bitcoin-related cryptographic functions. Python 3.11 provides a wide range of features and libraries that make it an ideal choice for developing CryptoDrain, while python-bitcoinlib enhances the program's capabilities by providing robust support for Bitcoin-specific operations.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before using CryptoDrain, you will need to have the following prerequisites in place:
* **Python 3:** CryptoDrain is built with Python 3.11, so you will need to have any Python 3 version installed on your system. You can download and install Python 3.11 from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).
* **python-bitcoinlib library:** CryptoDrain relies on the python-bitcoinlib library for interacting with the Bitcoin blockchain and performing Bitcoin-related operations. You can install this library using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command: `pip install python-bitcoinlib.`


### Usage
Using CryptoDrain is simple and straightforward. Just follow these steps:
* Clone the CryptoDrain repository from GitHub and install the required dependencies.
* Change the wallet withdrawal address to yours.
* Launch the CryptoDrain program in your preferred Python environment.
* Enter the seed phrase for the crypto wallet you want to sweep.
* Follow the prompts and instructions provided by the program to complete the wallet sweeping process.
* Once the process is complete, you will have successfully swept the crypto wallet using just the seed phrase, without the need for a derivation path.
